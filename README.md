## EXPLAIN VERSION CONTROL

Version control is a system that manages changes to a project's source code and tracks its history over time. It helps multiple developers work on the same project simultaneously, keeping track of changes, facilitating collaboration, and providing a mechanism to revert to previous states if needed. Git is a widely used version control system that offers several key features .

## EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GIT AND GTHUB

## Git: A Local Version Control Powerhouse

At its core, Git is a powerful and efficient distributed version control system designed by Linus Torvalds. Its primary function revolves around tracking changes in source code, maintaining a comprehensive history of a project, and enabling developers to work seamlessly on their local machines. With Git, developers can create commits, representing snapshots of the project at specific points in time. These commits are identified by unique hashes, providing a reliable and immutable record of the project's evolution.

Git's ability to manage branches allows developers to work concurrently on different aspects of a project without interfering with the main codebase. Branching facilitates isolated development, ensuring that experimental features or bug fixes can be implemented without affecting the stability of the main branch.

## GitHub: The Collaborative Hub for Git Repositories

While Git excels at local version control, GitHub extends its capabilities into the collaborative realm. As a web-based platform, GitHub serves as a remote repository hosting service, allowing developers to store their Git repositories in the cloud. This remote hosting enables seamless collaboration by providing a centralized location for project storage accessible to multiple developers.

GitHub introduces a graphical interface and a suite of collaboration features that enhance the Git experience. Pull requests, issues, and discussions are fundamental components of GitHub, fostering a collaborative environment where developers can review, comment on, and contribute to each other's work. Pull requests, in particular, facilitate the process of integrating changes from one branch into another, streamlining the collaborative development workflow.

## LIST THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GITFECTH AND GITPULL

1. Purpose:

git fetch: Retrieves changes from a remote repository without automatically merging them.
git pull: Fetches changes and automatically merges them into the current local branch.

2. Automatic Merging:

git fetch: Does not automatically update working directory or local branches.
git pull: Updates local branch and working directory automatically.

3. Workflow:

git fetch: Allows inspection of changes before deciding to merge.
git pull: Streamlines the process for quick updates without manual intervention.

4. Flexibility:

git fetch: Provides more control and flexibility over merging decisions.
git pull: Offers a quicker, more automated workflow.

5. Example Usage:

git fetch origin
git pull origin main



## EXPLAIN IN SIMPLE TERMS GIT REBASE AND THE COMMAND FOR IT.

Git rebase is a command used to organize and streamline the commit history of a Git repository. It helps to keep the commit history clean, linear, and more understandable. Instead of having a lot of merge commits, it allows you to incorporate the changes from one branch into another, making the history look neater.

GIT REBASE COMMAND: git rebase <branch-name>

## EXPLAIN IN SIMPLE TERMS GIT CHERRYPICK AND THE COMMAND FOR IT.

Git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to pick and apply specific commits from one branch and apply them onto another branch. It's like selecting and "picking" certain changes and placing them onto a different branch.

Git cherry-pick is handy when you want to selectively bring changes from one branch to another without merging the entire branch. Just be cautious when cherry-picking commits that have dependencies, as it might lead to unexpected behavior.

GIT CHERRYPICK COMMAND: git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
